# csv2actual

A command line utility to import bank transactions as csv into [Actual](https://actualbudget.com/).

<img src="cli-recording.gif" width="500" />

## Why?

Although [Actual](https://actualbudget.com/) supports importing bank statements from csv files, the exported format, as it is provided by the banks, sometimes needs to be adjusted manually. This utility aims to enable importing data from various banks, so there's no need to enter the statements by hand or change the exported csv files. Instead, the fields are mapped and parsed automatically.

## Supported Banks

| Bank | Country | Export Language |
| ---- | ------- | --------------- |
| [Belfius](https://www.belfius.be/) | Belgium | be |
| [neon](https://www.neon-free.ch/) | Switzerland | en |
| [Sparkasse](https://www.sparkasse.de/) | Germany | de |
| [ZÃ¼rcher Kantonalbank](https://www.zkb.ch/) | Switzerland | de |

If you'd like to see support for another institution, please open an issue or PR ðŸ’«
Please consider adding a dummy export to `tests/dummy-data`, so the import could be included in a test.

## Getting Started

Install as global package through npm:

```bash
npm install -g @jorisnoo/csv2actual
# OR
yarn global add @jorisnoo/csv2actual
```
